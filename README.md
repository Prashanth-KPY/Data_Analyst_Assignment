# Data Analyst Assignment

This repository contains my work for the **Data Analyst Assignment (Phase 2)**.  
I have included SQL scripts, spreadsheets, Python programs, and supporting files that show my approach to solving the tasks.

## Deliverables

### SQL
- Queries run without errors and return the expected results.
- Includes joins, aggregations, and time-based checks.

### Spreadsheets

  - `same_day` and `same_hour` flags
  - `same_day_count` and `same_hour_count` using `COUNTIFS`
  - `ticket_created_at` populated using `XLOOKUP`
- All formulas tested and working correctly.

### Python
