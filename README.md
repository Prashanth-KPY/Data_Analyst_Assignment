# Data Analyst Assignment

This repository contains my work for the **Data Analyst Assignment (Phase 2)**.  
I have included SQL scripts, spreadsheets, Python programs, and supporting files that show my approach to solving the tasks.

## Repository Structure

- **SQL/** → All SQL queries used for analysis.  
- **Spreadsheets/** → Excel/Google Sheets files with formulas for ticket and feedback analysis.  
- **Python/** → Python scripts for data processing and handling edge cases.  
- **README.md** → Documentation of the project.

## Deliverables

### SQL
- Queries run without errors and return the expected results.
- Includes joins, aggregations, and time-based checks.

### Spreadsheets
- Ticket analysis with formulas:
  - `same_day` and `same_hour` flags
  - `same_day_count` and `same_hour_count` using `COUNTIFS`
  - `ticket_created_at` populated using `XLOOKUP`
- All formulas tested and working correctly.

### Python
- Scripts handle edge cases and validate data.
- Code is commented for clarity and tested on sample datasets.

### Screen Recording
- Shows execution of SQL, spreadsheet formulas, and Python scripts.
- Uploaded to Google Drive with viewer access.
